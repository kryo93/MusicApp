A simple app that uses lastfm api to access their database, and manage your personal music.
there is just one admin access so just one account.

In order to use it create a new properties file (application.properties) in the 
appropriate location(spring boot wink wink) and add your api key like so

lastfm.api_key = YOUR_API_KEY 
lastfm.shared_secret = YOUR_SHARED_SECRET

and then enjoy the app.
